Appendix A: Reporting Bugs
----------------------------------------

The OntoNotes DB Tool remains in beta and has not yet been thoroughly
tested for various possible use.  We have tried to make sure that for
the most standard tasks that it is supposed to be used it works
without any hitches -- provided that the data is in the right
location, dependencies are properly met, etc.  With future releases of
the GALE OntoNotes corpus, we will be releasing updated versions
of this tool.  In the meanwhile, any major bug-fix revision would be
made available at the OntoNotes webpage hosted at
http://www.bbn.com/NLP/OntoNotes.

If you would like to report a bug, submit suggestions, or be notified
when an update is available, you should send an email to
pradhan@bbn.com
