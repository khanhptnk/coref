Database and API Design
----------------------------------------

Overview
--------

The entire database ER diagram is as shown below. The space is divided
logically into "Corpus", "Trees", "Propositions", "Senses", "Names",
"Coreference" and "Ontology."

   The OntoNotes database ER diagram

We will look at the individual group of tables in the following
subsections.  The design of the database was chosen to be close as
possible to the object-oriented structure of the overall OntoNotes
design.  It should also be noted that we have traded-off database
design principles for ease of querying in the computational semantics
space.  That is, we have not tried to reach the third or higher
database normal form.  The advantage of this is that there is a
seamless connection between the database world and the object-oriented
world, and therefore complex queries can be answered either using SQL
or using the methods of the objects themselves.  It should also be
noted that the primary keys of almost all the tables are composite
formed using the concatenation of individual foreign keys separated by
the "@" symbol.  This facilitates understanding the object in most
cases by just looking at its primary key.  The seamlessness is further
enhanced by the use of the same primary keys for object ids.  We
decided to use the MyISAM database engine, and enforce only the primary
key constraints, as adding foreign key constraints add a significant
overhead on the queries, and since the data are not likely to be
updated, it is only at load time that the constraint checking is
important.  Constraint checking is hence done in the DB Tool logic.
Even though MyISAM ignores foreign key constraints, we do include
them in table create statements to document them.

Corpus
------

The collection of tables that manage the corpora are shown in Figure 1.1
The "ontonotes" table stores the main ontonotes id.  There can be more
than one "subcorpus"' (subcorpora) associated with the OntoNotes
table.  Each subcorpus represents an arbitrary set of documents, by
default all the documents for a given source.  The "subcorpus" table
has associated with it a "language_id" and can contain many "file"s.
Each file can contain one or more "documents".  In the current
situation, there is only one document per file in all subcorpora, but
this might change in the future.  Then, each document has associated
with it a list of "sentences"

   Corpus Tables

Trees
-----

The tables that are used to represent the Treebank are shown in Figure
1.2.  The central table in this region is the "tree" table which
contains all the nodes in all the trees in the corpora.  Since we use
the Treebank tokenization as the lowest granularity for identifying
elements in the corpus, we show the "token" table in this region.
It contains back-pointer to the sentence and the tree that it belongs
to. Associated with the tree nodes are various meta tags such as the
part-of-speech tag, stored in the "pos_type" table, the phrase
types, stored in the "phrase_type" table, the function tags stored
in the "function tag" table, and the syntactic links stored in the
"syntactic_link" table.

   Treebank Tables

Propositions
------------

The tables that depict the PropBank information are shown in Figure
1.3. At the core is the "proposition" table which stores all the
propositions in the corpora.  The "predicate" and the
"predicate_node" tables store the many-to-many relationship that can
be associated with the predicates and the nodes in the tree.  The same
is the case with the "argument" and the "argument_node" table.
The "argument_type" and the "predicate_type" tables store the
predicate and argument types as defined in PropBank.

   Proposition Tables

Word Senses
-----------

The OntoNotes word sense is stored in the "on_sense" table shown in
Figure 1.4  There are connections between the
OntoNotes sense and the Proposition Bank's frames which are captured in
the "on_sense_type_pb_sense_type" table.  The WordNet senses which
are grouped to form the OntoNotes sense and occasionally vice-versa
are captured by the "on_sense_type_wn_sense_type" table.  The frames
files in PropBank restrict the types of core arguments that a
predicate can take, and this information is stored in the
"pb_sense_type_argument_type_table" which then has connections to
the "argument_type" table in the PropBank table space.  It should be
noted that the WordNet mapping are only available for the English part
of the corpus.  There is no equivalent in the Chinese part.

   Word Sense Tables

Name
----

The Name Entity relations are stored in the "name_entity" and
"name_entity_type" tables shown in Figure 1.5 These are then connected
to the respective tokens in the sentence, and are also connected to
the appropriated nodes in the tree whenever there is a possible
alignment.

   Name Tables


Coreference
-----------

The "coreference_link" and "coreference_chain" tables, shown in Figure
1.6, in the Coreference table space store the information required to
capture equivalent entities in the corpus.  They also have information
on the string span in the corpus that they are associated with, and in
case of alignments (which in most cases is true since the coreference
annotation was done on top of the treebank, withholding some
exceptional entities) the node information is stored in the
"coreference_link" table.

   Coreference Tables



Banks
-----

Each annotation project created a set of related data which is called
a "bank" of that annotation -- in accordance with Treebank, PropBank,
etc.  Each bank has three representations: as a table in the database,
as as a python object, and as a file.  The correspondences are:

  =============  ============================================  =============================  =============
  **Bank Name**  **Database Table**                            **Python Module**              **Extension**
  =============  ============================================  =============================  =============
  tree           ``tree``                                      :mod:`on.corpora.tree`         ``.parse``
  sense          ``on_sense``                                  :mod:`on.corpora.sense`        ``.sense``
  proposition    ``argument``, ``predicate``                   :mod:`on.corpora.proposition`  ``.prop``
  coreference    ``coreference_link``                          :mod:`on.corpora.coreference`  ``.coref``
  name           ``name_entity``                               :mod:`on.corpora.name`         ``.name``
  speaker        ``speaker_sentence``                          :mod:`on.corpora.speaker`      ``.speaker``
  parallel       ``parallel_sentence``, ``parallel_document``  :mod:`on.corpora.parallel`     ``.parallel``
  =============  ============================================  =============================  =============

This elucidates the connection between the three levels of
representation -- text files, python objects and database tables.
There are actually multiple database tables used to represent the
data.  In the correspondence table above, we've listed the database
table which contains the actual annotation alongside the python module
which contains that bank.  For example, for word sense annotation, we
list the on_sense table along side the :mod:`on.corpora.sense` module.
The on_sense table has the actual annotation, including fields for the
lemma, sense, and a pointer to the annotated word in the tree.  The
:mod:`on.corpora.sense` module describes a
:class:`on.corpora.sense.sense_bank` containing
:class:`on.corpora.sense.sense_tagged_document` instances which
contain :class:`on.corpora.sense.on_sense` instances.  This also elides the
supporting annotation, such as the sense inventories needed to
interpret and ground the sense annotations.  For the details on each
bank, look up the documentation for the referenced python module.
