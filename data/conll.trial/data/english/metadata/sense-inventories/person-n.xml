            The point-of-view of a narrative or verbal act.  There are only three kinds of person: first, second, and third. 
        </commentary>
        <examples>
            John sometimes talked about himself in the third person.
            I prefer novels that are written in the first person.
            You rarely see stories written in the second person, do you?
