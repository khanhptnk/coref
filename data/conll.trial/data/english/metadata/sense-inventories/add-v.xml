            NOTE: Throughout this task, please beware of adjectival usages, such
            as "added value"(adj+noun)--but note that "added value" may also
            be a verb+object (sense 3).  Please decide carefully, and tag "X" for adjectives.
            NOTE: Compare carefully to sense 2; in this sense, a unit is given to an entity, a 
            portion is given to a total.  In sense 2, parts 1 and 2 are combined to create
            the entity. 
            Syntax Includes:
            NP1[agent] ADD (NP2[theme]) (PP{to NP3[target]})
            In stocks:
            NP1[financial institution] ADD NP2[numerical value] to NP3[total worth]
