            Note: the subject is the recipient of harm, -not- the cause of it (Sense 2)

            We are in no danger from the hurricane, as it has moved out to sea. (Note: although the hurricane is the danger, the sentence here is describing the -state- of the -subject- when using the term 'danger', thus Sense 1 applies, -not- Sense 2)
