            Is: KNOCK COLD, KNOCK OUT
            NOTE: this 'render unconscious' often is a result of being 'knocked down' and may
            be confused with sense 1; sense 1 ONLY has the implication of being hit (you may
            be knocked down without being made unconscious) but the additional inference
            of being knocked unconscious is in this sense
