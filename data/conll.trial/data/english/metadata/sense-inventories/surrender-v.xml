            Syntax is: NP1[agent] SURRENDER
            NP1[agent] SURRENDER (NP2) to NP3
            NOTE: compare carefully to sense 2; in this sense, there may actually be an 
            object (NP2) "surrendered" (oneself, one's life, one's soul)--in such
            cases, the surrendering of NP2 renders NP1 under the control of NP3

            Syntax is: NP1[agent] SURRENDER NP2[+possession] (to NP3)
            NOTE: compare carefully to sense 1; in this sense, the surrendering of NP2
            does not entail that NP3 has control over NP1
